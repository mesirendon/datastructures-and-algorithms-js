# Data Structures
Data is a broad term that could mean any type of information. Structuring such information is related to organizing and storing it for future access or manipulation in an efficient manner.

**Note on exercises**: I'm not using the actual implementation here because
1. These notebooks do not allow me to import classes like a structured project.
2. The idea of each exercise notebook is to show the real solution. Thus importing would have the reader opening a new window, and I want to keep them on the site to focus on the problem under analysis.
