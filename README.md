# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository written in JavaScript is a compilation of the most-known data structures and algorithms.

## Why JavaScript?
It's usual to see data structures and algorithms taught in Java. However, getting a Java development environment might be troublesome, whereas JavaScript can be ran with no more than a few steps.

JavaScript is also a flexible language that allows performing actions that could save time and is helpful for explaining a concept. If you want to transpile this knowledge to any other language, it might be easier for you after understanding what's explained here.

## Data Structures
